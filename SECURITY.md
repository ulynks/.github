# Security Policy

**Please report security issues by emailing [jv-conseil@proton.me] :email:**

Most normal bugs :bug: can be reported by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/issues), but due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that they **not** be publicly reported in this fashion.

Instead, if you believe you’ve found something that has security implications, please send a description of the issue via email to **[jv-conseil@proton.me]**.

Mail sent to **[jv-conseil@proton.me]** can be **encrypted :lock_with_ink_pen:** with our [PGP public key :key:]

Once you’ve submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment from us, and depending on the action to be taken, you may receive further followup emails.
